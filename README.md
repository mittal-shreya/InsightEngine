* **Identifies Profanity:** Uses a **custom profanity filter**, excluding liquor-related words.  

### **Contextual Analysis (Tier 2)**  
* **Relevance Check:** Uses **RoBERTa (Zero-Shot Classification)** to verify if responses match the question.  

### **Deep Learning & AI Detection (Tier 3)**  
* **DistilBERT Model:** Predicts whether a response is **low-quality**.  
* **RoBERTa Model:** Assigns **relevance scores** to each answer.  

### **Final Flagging & Report Generation**  
* Flags responses based on **rule-based & AI checks**.  
* **Streamlit Dashboard** displays flagged vs. clean responses.
